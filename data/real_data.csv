"2025/03/21 3:19:01 pm GMT+3","I enjoy learning how humans could teach a machine to do human tasks","i tought neural networks are just about RNN and FFNN","Enjoyable"
"2025/03/21 5:13:44 pm GMT+3","I liked how complex topics were explained in a simple and clear way.","It was sometimes hard to apply what I learned when trying to code or implement it on my own.","A deep and interesting course that helped me understand how modern AI works."
"2025/03/22 7:55:36 pm GMT+3","I enjoyed this course because it covers a new and highly relevant topic. Nowadays, it's essential for everyone to understand the fundamentals of this subject, as it has a significant impact on both professional and personal life. This course not only provided me with new information but also gave me a better perspective on current trends and the needs of society."," it could have been more effective if there were more examples worked through in the lab sessions. This would have helped solidify the concepts better. Additionally, I felt that there was too much content presented, and it would have been more beneficial to focus more on understanding the material deeply rather than covering so much in a short amount of time."," I was eager to learn new concepts and expand my knowledge."

"2025/03/23 12:31:00 pm GMT+3","Yes, It is about future","Too many new informations","Class is interesting because we are learing something that can be applied in real world"
"2025/03/24 12:49:07 pm GMT+3","Exciting: It's highly relevant to real-world applications, and god knows it feels good to brag about it to my friends.","It's hard to digest ","So far so good"
"2025/03/24 4:10:48 pm GMT+3","I appreciated the depth of topics like neural networks, backpropagation, and optimization, which enhanced my understanding of deep learning concepts","While the deep learning course was insightful, some aspects were challenging. The mathematical complexity, especially in areas like backpropagation and optimization, was sometimes overwhelming","The deep learning course was an engaging and insightful experience, an opportunity to learn techniques that will help in accomplishing the future projects"
"2025/03/24 5:54:21 pm GMT+3","The understanding of the work of the capsule network and what are they for","Lots of to assimilate in short time and complexities","I'm getting more interested , and less confused about what is a model and AI stuff"
"2025/03/24 11:23:22 pm GMT+3","I liked that we got to fine-tune real models—it made learning more interesting.","Some topics were hard to understand at first, and training took a long time.","A good course that taught me a lot, but some parts were challenging."
"2025/03/27 10:38:12 pm GMT+3","It is/was helpful in understanding Neural Networks to a grater degree.","Nothing.","Enjoyment and it being useful for doing research using neural networks."
"2025/03/28 9:19:23 am GMT+3","I enjoyed learning about theoretical things in deep neural network because it shows how deep neural network extract significant features from data features ","The challenge is the complexity of model optimization and the understanding of all hyperparameter which can be difficult","I think this course can seem difficult somehow but still very interesting to understand different factors of deep neural network "
"2025/03/29 5:15:32 am GMT+3","I have enjoy lots of things about this course because of teacher she can teach us very well..","Learning deep neural networks can be frustrating because training takes a long time, choosing the right settings is tricky, and understanding why the model makes mistakes is difficult but also i can’t read before in my BS degree.","This course was challenging but insightful, requiring patience to overcome complex concepts, computational demands, and debugging difficulties."
